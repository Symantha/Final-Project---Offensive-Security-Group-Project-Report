# Final-Project---Offensive-Security-Group-Project-Report

# Worked as a group with Kevin Alvarado, Muhammed Jawara, Mitch Murov and myself to create a pentesting report on the attack, defense, and analysis of a vulnerable network.

We each built out a lab consisting of a Kali Linux box (the attacker), an ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, & Kibana) server, a Capstone server, and 2 target machines.  We each performed nmap scans, found a plethora of vulnerabilities, acted as "bad actors" and exploited some of the found vulnerabilites.  We then created a report where we mapped out the network topology and reported on the critical system vulnerabilities & how we exploited them.  We each took a portion of the report and then put the pieces together and worked on unifying the format.  Above is the link to open the report.  Hope you enjoy it!
